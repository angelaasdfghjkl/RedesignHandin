      <h2>Context</h2>
      <p>A few summers ago, I chanced upon a new restaurant in my neighborhood called
        Sushi Village. Eager to check out the menu offerings of the restaurant, I searched
        for its website on Google. The second the website loaded, I was immediately taken aback
        by its outdated design and confusing interface. So for this project, I would like to
        evaluate and redesign the site using usability principles and key design concepts. Browse the
        <a href="<https://www.sushivillageflushing.com/">original website</a> and see for yourself
        and let's embark on this journey together.

      <h2>Problems</h2>

      <h3>I. Usability</h3>
        <p>The Sushi Village website itself has quite a few usability problems. There are multiple empty
          pages and the navigational flow is confusing. To break these specific flaws down, Iâ€™ll be examining
          the website and grading it in the following four categories: efficiency, memorability, usability,
          and learnability
